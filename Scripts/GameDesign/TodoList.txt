Game loops:
    - Map: Start at 1 location, branches to different paths.
        - Each path has icon for a reward for the previous encounter
            - rewards: new cards, increased card rarity, increased number of card choices, card removal from deck
                - show card rarity, number of card choices in corner of path selection screen
        - locations: regular encounter, mini-boss encounter, forge (all scale with level)
            - forge: spend $ to upgrade existing cards
            - mini-boss: gives unique rewards (maybe a card that has to do with the boss mechanics)
            - regular encounters: always give money
        - Leads to one big boss (should be very hard to beat)
            - Find ideal # of encounters so the player can build a deck with synergy
            - Defeating boss, gives different starter deck maybe? or increases hand/deck size?
        
        -TO-DO:
            - Path Selection Scene
                - UI with interactable/hoverable locations
            - Forge Scene
                - User can select a card within the deck to show what it will become
                - Submit button after viewing the enhanced card
            - Reward Scene after encounter
                - UI for card selection
                - UI for card removal


Ideas:
    - Boss Mechanics:
        - Stun meter: After certain damage threshold, they are stunned for a turn

    - Encounter Mechanics:
        - Enemy cards injected into draw pile, will disappear after discarded or played (unstable keyword)

    - Rewards:
        - Unstable cards (one use, really OP, used when in trouble or bosses)?
        - Removal of cards
        - Upgrading cards (max of 1-2 upgrades depending on card, maybe less rare has more upgrades to balance the epic/rare cards)
