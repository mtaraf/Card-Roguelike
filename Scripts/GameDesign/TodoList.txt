Art:
    - Create tooltip outline for top, bottom, left, right
    - Make Health Bar UI in pixel art
    - Make new card background for each class



Game loops:
    - Map: Start at 1 location, branches to different paths.
        - Each path has icon for a reward for the previous encounter
            - rewards: new cards, increased card rarity, increased number of card choices, card removal from deck
                - show card rarity, number of card choices in corner of path selection screen
        - locations: regular encounter, mini-boss encounter, forge (all scale with level)
            - forge: spend $ to upgrade existing cards
            - mini-boss: gives unique rewards (maybe a card that has to do with the boss mechanics)
            - regular encounters: always give money
        - Leads to one big boss (should be very hard to beat)
            - Find ideal # of encounters so the player can build a deck with synergy
            - Defeating boss, gives different starter deck maybe? or increases hand/deck size?
